This application about my learning spring boot in documentation.
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.4.RELEASE/reference/html/index.html

First all we include in pom:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>

In documentation teache instaling spring CLI, but i dont want that. I will do in future to test.


Main points in this first section is:

The annotaion @RestController and @RequestMapping is Spring MVC annotations (they are not specific to Spring Boot).

We can use line command "mvn package" to create a file jar it will create file into target and this jar you can use
command line to start with "java -jar target/myproject-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"

So in this point we version our application using

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Example Commit Message"
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
git push origin master
